# MCopter

A quadcopter built from scratch.

Currently there is a working PCB for the flight controller + basic firmware.

# Working (kind-of) features

* Simple PID flight stabilization
* Radio communication via external radio module (both controlling the copter and sending telemtry data to the controller

# Planned

* Designing custom frame and 3D print it
* Using an embedded radio solution (probably nRF24 based)
